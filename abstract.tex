An important skill in robotics is the ability to predict how objects behave during manipulation.  This is necessary to enable many manipulations to be planned. Models informed by mechanical theory are powerful, but are hard to tune so as to match the precise behaviour of particular objects.  An alternative explored here is to learn a model of the object's motion from data, to {\em learn to predict}. We study this for push manipulation. The paper begins by formulating a prediction problem for the case where forces and intrinsic parameters are not observable, and modelling kinematics is sufficient. Then we formulate the problem of learning to predict in two different machine learning frameworks: i) regression and ii) density estimation. Our learning approach is modular: many simple object and context specific predictors are learned. We show empirically that such object and context specific predictors typically outperform a rigid body dynamics engine tuned on the same data.  In addition, we show how to extend the density estimation approach using a product of experts. The paper gives first results on real objects. These show that this product of experts formulation allows transfer of learning to objects of novel shape, and to novel actions. With the right representation and machine learning method we further show that transfer learning can match the performance of a rigid body dynamics engine when making predictions about novel objects or actions.
